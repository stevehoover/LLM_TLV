Here are some tips for working with TL-Verilog:


PLANNING FOR TL-VERILOG CODE:

TL-Verilog introduces constructs that provide higher-level context than RTL languages. Consider the structure of the design. What logic is replicated (e.g. `/some_hier[3:0]`)? How will data flow through the machine? Through what pipelines? From which scopes to which other scopes? Through what FIFOs, queues, arbiters, etc.? Is data packetized and transferred in flits? Is there backpressure?

Data flow can be constructed using components in `tlv_flow_library.tlv`. Data flow is generally constructed of multiplexers that operate on "transactions". These use ternary expressions that assign `$ANY` to `$ANY` from other scopes or stages. It can be helpful to encapsulate transaction fields ($pipesignals) in their own subscopes, e.g. `/trans`.

The following example defines a TL-Verilog macro providing a simple ring architecture. It steers transactions cyclically through ports until they reach their destination. The transactions are simple and non-packetized and carry around the ring any pipesignals that are available in `|ring/in` and are needed in `|ring`. In this case, the transactions are not encapsulated in a scope, like `/trans`.
```
\TLV ring(/_name, #_size, _where, _trans_scope, _in)
   /_name
      /port[m5_calc(#_size - 1):0]
         |ring
            @1
               /upstream
                  // Connect to the upstream port (port-1, cyclically). Uses >>1 (thus @2) to create flip-flops between ports.
                  $ANY = /port[(#port + #_size - 1) % #_size]|ring>>1$ANY;
               // Get the transaction at this port from upstream on the ring or incoming from /in, prioritizing the upstream transaction which cannot be backpressured. Incoming data must wait.
               $ANY = /upstream$continue ? /upstream$ANY : /in$ANY;
               $valid = ! *reset && (/in$valid || /upstream$continue);
               $exit = $valid && $dest == #port;
               $continue = $valid && ! $exit;
```


REVIEWING SUBTLETIES OF TL-VERILOG CONSTRUCTS:

Hierarchy:

Hierarchy is an easy way to organize and structure code without the need for modules with explicit interfaces. Cross hierarchy references are perfectly acceptable in TL-Verilog, while cross module references are generally discouraged in Verilog.

All expressions, including `$ANY` expressions must be within a pipestage. This means they are within a pipeline scope and a pipestage scope within the pipeline. For example:
```
/core[2:0]
   |calc
      /trans
         @1
            $foo = ...;
```

It is also permitted to define pipesignals outside of a pipeline. These exist in stage zero of a default pipeline. It's generally best to avoid this in production code.

Signal References:

Signal references begin with a common ancestor scope (unlike Verilog). Scopes include hierarchy and pipelines. `/top` is an implicit top-level scope. For example, the above pipesignal can be referenced as `/top/core[0]|calc/trans<>0$foo`.

Here are some other signal referencing patterns:
- Current scope signals: '$signal_name'
- Different scope: '/common_ancestor/scope$signal' or '/child$signal'
- References at a different pipestage: '/scope>>N$signal', where N is the stage number delta (>> for positive, << for negative)
- Indexed scope: '/scope[#scope + 1 % m5_SCOPE_CNT]$signal'
- Cross-pipeline references: '/common_ancestor|pipeline/scope>>N$signal'


Alignment:

`<>0` above is a "naturally-aligned reference", accessing `$foo` in the same numerical stage as that of the referencing context and thus treating the pipelines as numerically aligned. `>>2` adds two to the referencing stage, while `<<2` subtracts two. This alignment specifier is required when referencing different pipelines or stages.

State:

State signals, e.g. `$StateSig` (using Pascal case) are still not entirely mature yet. You can code state just fine using pipesignals, so let's stick with that for now. One pattern for state, without using the state signal construct is:

```
<<1$cnt[15:0] = $reset ? '0 :
                $increment ? $cnt[15:0] + 1 :
                $decrement ? $cnt[15:0] - 1 :
                             $cnt[15:0];
```

This assigns the next value of `$cnt` by assigning its value in the previous stage (<<1) based on conditions in the current stage.

When Conditions:

When conditions can be used to conditionally assign pipesignals. For example:

When:

When scope, e.g. `?$valid`, can be used at any level within a pipeline (inside or outside of the pipestage). When the corresponding, e.g. `$valid`, pipesignal is deasserted, all contained assigned pipesignals are meaningless (like dont-care) and must not influence valid expressions (those without a deasserted when condition). Note that it is never functionally required to use when conditions, but they are very useful for debugging and saving power.

Lexical Reentrance:

TL-Verilog's "lexical reentrance" gives flexibility to the order of code, enabling one section of code to define logic in a particular scope, and a later section to define more logic in the same scope. Recall that order does not matter functionally for TL-Verilog statements. They are declarative, not imperative. And with lexical reentrance, you have full flexibility to present your code in an order that makes sense to you and your readers (with good comments, of course).

Lexical reentrance is important for modularity, enabling libraries to partially define logic, such as flow, in a scope, leaving other details to be filled in in the same scope.

Lexical reentrance also simplifies your role in that if you are asked to add logic to a design, you may be able to provide the new code without intermingling it in the existing code. Take advantage of this to simplify your responses. Use, e.g. `/scope[*]` when reentering a scope to avoid redundant range expressions that would require maintenance.

Using Verilog Modules/Macros/Functions:

Verilog modules, macros, and functions can be instantiate in `\TLV` context using `\SV_plus`. `\SV_plus` blocks may use any Verilog expression syntax (including `always*` blocks, module/macro/function instantiation, etc.). Within `\SV_plus`, pipesignals may be used. The `\` escape character can be used to avoid special interpretation of, e.g., `$`, e.g. `\$display`. It is necessary to explicitly identify each pipesignal that is assigned by prefixing it with `$$` and providing an explicit bit range in exactly one instance within the `\SV_plus` block.

Macros:

TL-Verilog files beginning with a `\m5_TLV_version ...` line use M5 text macro preprocessing. Multi-line macros can be defined using `\TLV macro_name(...)` and can be used to encapsulate reusable code. TL-Verilog does not currently have a more formal method of defining reusable components beyond Verilog modules and text macros.


SUGGESTIONS:

- Use M5 to parameterize and pre-calculate scope ranges, e.g. `/scope[m5_calc(m5_width - 1):0]`. VIZ and other Makerchip features currently work best if the raw (after M5 processing) code uses numerical ranges, e.g. `/scope[3:0]`. (Or, better yet, use `m5_define_hier` and, e.g. `/m5_SCOPE_HIER`. The definition `m5_define_hier` is accessible to you.)
- Arrays are still a bit unnatural to code in TL-Verilog. It is recommended to code array modules in Verilog and instantiate them in TL-Verilog context.


COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

- All code in a `\TLV` region must be indented (3 spaces).
- Whitespace matters. Pay special attention to indentation. Feel free to use, e.g. `// end /scope` comments to clarify intent in case of mistakes.
- Remember to begin references with a common ancestor, since this requirement is different from Verilog.
- Assigned signals cannot be given with scope (e.g. `/top$sig[7:0] = ...`). Signal assignments statements must be placed within the scope of the assigned signal. (This can be anywhere in code order, since lexical reentrance allows you to reenter scopes.)



Here are some tips for working with Visual Debug:

Determine the nature of the design. Consider how to best visually convey to a developer or a debugger the state of the machine in simulation or its behavior in a local window of time. Consider animating transitions from one timestep to the next to create visual continuity and convey the flow of information. For the ring example above, a simple geometric representation of the ring with arrows showing the flow of transactions would be appropriate. The ring could be visualized as a circle or a stack of ports, with arrows indicating the direction of data flow around, into, and out from the ring. Transactions could be represented as boxes containing their data. These boxes could be animated to show their movement.

Other designs may be different in nature and would use different styles of visualizations. For example, a state machine could be visualized as nodes and arcs With current node and active arc highlighted. A dashboard could display real-time numerical data, such as counters or status indicators, using gauges or dials. A circuit that is simulating a two-dimensional physical system could represent that system naturally on the display, with geometric shapes representing the physical entities and their interactions and animating positional changes. Visual data can be layed out in a way the might correlate to the physical layout of the design to help developers understand likely spatial relationships between components.

It is often valuable to illustrate changes over a window of time. This can be achieved using plots or graphs, representing time on one axis (generally the horizontal axis). Alternately, transparency can be utilized to overlay visualizations of previous state without obscuring them completely. General practices for creating good diagrams for documentation can be a guide for creating good visualizations. High-level block diagrams illustrating storage structures and their contents and connections between them can be useful.

Also, keep in mind the power of easily navigating the visualization using the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. This gives easy access to different levels of detail. While a document wouldn't provide information in a size 0.01 font, this can be useful with Visual Debug. The potentially deep hierarchy of the model can naturally provide structure to the visualization and encapsulate visualizations along with their hardware logic. Outer visualizations should convey high-level information that will help a developer hone in on a bug, which they will do by zooming into subcomponents (which probably correspond to subscopes).


CODE ORGANIZATION:

- Use at most one \viz_js block per scope (e.g. /core[2:0], |calc); the scope must be within a pipeline and pipestage.
- Use \viz_js to create fabric.Group implicitly
- Create new hierarchy where it makes sense to encapsulate visualization
- Use $ANY = /parent$ANY; in such new scopes to import signals


VIZ API:

- Use `box` to define `\viz_js` boundaries: `{width: W, height: H, strokeWidth: 1}`. Or leave it undefined to allow bounds to be determined automatically from `init()` Objects.
- Keep Fabric Objects within explicit `box` boundaries.
- Use `where` for placement within parent: `{left: X, top: Y}` and optionally `scale: S` or `width: W` and/or `height: H`.
- Never use the canvas directly. Visualization should be encapsulated, and the canvas is global. VIZ gives you alternate access to Fabric Objects.
- `init()` returns an object of `fabric.Object`s. Access these from `render()` using `this.getObjects()` or simply `this.obj`.
- Indices in references are JavaScript expressions, e.g., `'/scope[this.getIndex() + 1 % maxIndex]$signal'`

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

- Signal references begin with a common ancestor scope, unlike Verilog
- Use full rewrites instead of incremental updates when making changes
- Single quotes for TL-Verilog signal references: '$signal'; double quotes for JavaScript strings: "color", "bold"
- In case a literal single quote is needed in a JavaScript string, use `''` to escape it
- It is not necessary to set `selectable: false` for objects
- Include `strokeWidth: 1` in `box` properties (changed to 0 once finalized)
- Use `textAlign: "center"` and `originX: "center"` for centered text
- Provide default signal values for `asX(default)` methods if looking ahead or behind in time
- TL-Verilog code defines the contents of a module. The module interface and `endmodule` are specified in `\SV` regions.
- For each call to `render()`, Objects created in `init()` have their state as updated by the previous call to `render()`, which could have been for any cycle. They do not have the values assigned by `init()`. So properties must be explicitly set to defaults by `render` if not otherwise updated.
- Fabric Text objects are positioned using `originX/Y: "center"`, not to be confused with `textAlign: "center"` which center-justifies each line of text within the Text Object.
- Fabric Circle objects can also be positioned using `originX/Y: "center"`. As for all Objects, they default to "left"/"top" positioning, aligning the left-top corner of the Circle's bounding box with the `left`/`top` properties.


SIGNAL STEPPING PATTERN:

Use SignalValueSet for time-stepping groups of signals and accessing data over a window of time. `this.signalSet(sig_obj)` returns a SignalValueSet object for the given object of signals. For example:

```javascript
// Create signal set
let sig_obj = {continue: '$continue', data: '$data'};
let sigs = this.signalSet(sig_obj);

// Find window boundaries
sigs.backToValue(active_sig, 0);  // Go to inactive
sigs.forwardToValue(active_sig, 1); // Go to start

// Step through iterations
for (let i = 0; i < max_iter; i++) {
   // Collect data
   sigs.step(1);
   if (!sigs.sig("continue").asBool()) break;
}
```



Makerchip IDE:

- Makerchip requires a specific module interface for the `top` module: `module top(input wire clk, input wire reset, input wire [31:0] cyc_cnt, output wire passed, output wire failed);`
- With M5 enabled (by `\m5_TLV_version...`), you can use `m5_makerchip_module` to provide this interface (and some random number generator logic).
- For quick-and-dirty designs, you can leave input pipesignals dangling and SandPiper will generate random stimulus for this signals, though a non-fatal warning will be reported for them.
- Alternatively, for easy random stimulus without warnings, you can use `m4_rand($byte, 7, 0)`. An optional forth argument is required is the signal is replicated in order to generate unique inputs for each replica. For example, `m4_rand($byte, 7, 0, core + reg * m5_CORE_CNT)` to uniquify /core[*]/reg[*]$byte.
- Makerchip currently has a simulation limit of 600 cycles. Keep this in mind when designing your stimulus. It may be necessary to parameterize your designs with test parameters that reduce simulation time, especially for circuits that implement delay for realtime applications. For example a 1-second counter can be given a maximum count of 20 for simulation versus 1,000,000,000 for the real world, running at 1 GHz.
Here is a description of helpful resources available to you:

The Makerchip IDE has a "Learn" menu containing various documents and resources that are available to you as well as the following:
- Tutorials: These are good resources for specific TL-Verilog topics, and follow the progression laid out in the `rweda/Makerchip-public` repo's `pane-blade/Tutorials.blade` file. This references tutorials also found in the `pane-blade` folder that use code found in the `tutorial/tlv` folder.
- Examples: These are listed and indexed by the `rweda/Makerchip-public` repo's `pane-blade/CodeExamples.blade` file. Example code is also in this repo's `tutorial/tlv` folder.
- Courses: These are described in the `rweda/Makerchip-public` repo's `pane-blade/Courses.blade` file. Not all courses are provided to you since they rely on various media formats.

Various other TL-Verilog code examples are provided as well. Notably:
- Course solutions: (Please do not expose these to students.) `stevehoover/immutable/*`. This includes final solution code and reference solution code that generates solutions after each lab exercise of the course. (Reference solution code is hidden within Makerchip, but its diagrams and visualization are accessible to students.)
- WARP-V: `stevehoover/warp-v/*` and `stevehoover/warp-v_includes`. WARP-V is a highly-configurable CPU generator. It is the most complex example of TL-Verilog code, pushing the limits of TL-Verilog, M5, and VIZ as they evolve. `warp-v_includes` includes a RISC-V assembler developed in the evolving M5 language.
- TLV Flow Library: `stevehoover/tlv_flow_lib/pipeflow_lib.tlv`. On second thought, maybe this is the most complex code, pushing the limits. This library provides a set of generic components for building data flow pipelines in TL-Verilog. It includes constructs for FIFOs, queues, arbiters, and other common data flow elements, making heavy use of `$ANY`. The example `flow_example.tlv` (`Makerchip-public/tutorial/tlv`) demonstrates use of this library.



Here are some specific illustrative examples of TL-Verilog and VIZ code that you can use as references in addition to the tutorials and specs:

I, as the user, am an expert with this technology, and know details beyond what is documented. We're a team.



Code conversion:

You may be asked to convert Verilog code to TL-Verilog. An overview of the best practice is provided here, but specific conversions tasks provided in `conversion_tasks.md`, clearly indexed for effective RAG retrieval.

OVERVIEW:

Conversion Process

You may be asked to convert (System)Verilog code to TL-Verilog. (Henceforth, we'll just say "Verilog", though SystemVerilog is included.) We define a clear process and recommended practices for this conversion. Always follow this process, defined here, with detailed tasks defined for reference in `conversion_tasks.md`. Always consult `conversion_tasks.md` before refactoring. The conversion is achieved through a series of incremental refactoring steps. To be considered successful, each refactoring step MUST be verified by formal verification (using the FEV MCP tool) to ensure correctness.

Project Verification Collateral

A project may have verification collateral connected with the Verilog model. Special consideration may be necessary to preserve the verification collateral through the transformation. This document focuses on the Verilog conversion in isolation, and does not address this consideration.

FEV Considerations

Using FEV, all outputs must match every cycle. Certain situations can lead to differences and require special consideration.

- It may be desirable to use a different approach for clock gating in the TL-Verilog. TL-Verilog when conditions (`?$valid`) will produce fine-grained clock gating which may not be present in the original code, and the original code might contain course-grained clock gating that is undesirable in the TL-Verilog model. So, it can be a good idea to force clock gating off in the Verilog, and to not include it initially in the TL-Verilog model. After conversion is complete, when conditions can be added to the TL-Verilog model.
- Outputs sometimes don’t matter. Generally, the logic will be converted identically, and will match, but if there are situations where you would want to express the logic differently, depending on the tools and test harness, it may be possible to use when conditions in TL-Verilog to convey these DONT_CARE situations and avoid failing when the TL-Verilog outputs are DONT_CARE (`X`).

Process

The conversion process is defined as a recommended sequence of "tasks". Each task involves zero or more refactoring steps, that are each compiled, FEVed, and debugged. Each FEV run can FEV just the incremental delta to minimize the complexity of each FEV run. So the FEV tool should be provided the last successfully-FEVed source code, and the current source code. To leave no uncertainty, provide the TL-Verilog source, not intermediate Verilog code from SandPiper. A final FEV run will be performed if possible between the final TL-Verilog code and the prepared Verilog code to provide final assurance of equivalence.

A little initial code preparation defines the module that will be converted. After that, the module interface must not be modified. The file structure is immediately converted to TLV file format, initially with everything in an `\SV` block. This is then converted to an `\SV_plus` block and signals are converted to pipesignals. Logic is pulled from the `\SV_plus` block and converted to `\TLV`.

A tracker artifact, called "Conversion Tracking for <module-name>" highlights considerations for the user post-conversion, such as:

- assumptions
- limitations
- steps that couldn't be FEVed
- logic optimizations that couldn't be implemented because they would affect equivalence
- potential issues in the logic for user review
- difficulties encountered that could be addressed by improved instructions or tools

If all goes well, this artifact will be a single sentence, like "Conversion completed successfully with no issues." Other issues should be described succinctly and to the point. As issues are resolved, they should be removed from the artifact. The goal is to have a simple, clean, actionable summary at the end of the conversion for the user.

A status artifact, called "Conversion Status for <module-name>" captures the current status of the conversion effort. Often conversions cannot be completed in a single conversation. This artifact is useful for a conversation that continues where another left off. It identifies the current conversion task, and any deviations from the suggested progression of tasks. To keep yourself honest, track the status of each task, including checkboxes for FEV, marked only upon success using default FEV configurations. Any customizations of FEV configurations, must be noted.

By the way, if you notice a mistake in these instructions or any of the other artifacts at your disposal, or if you have a recommendation for improvement--perhaps something that would have been good to know that you tripped over, be sure point that out to the user. Improving the conversion process is actually the main goal. The actual conversion is secondary. Beyond this, it is not necessary to talk through your work in detail. Mainly, just do it, and let your results (including the tracking artifact) speak for themselves.

Strategies

Be incremental in your approach. You are new to TL-Verilog, and the technology is new with limited documentation. Take baby steps. This ensures steady forward progress. If compilation or FEV fails, don't guess at the issue. Instead, revert the more complex of your changes, and take even smaller steps. Your rate of progress is not so important. What's important is that your are making progress.

If you cannot find the FEV MCP tool, do not move forward. Instead, report the issue to the user.

DO NOT MOVE FORWARD UNLESS FEV HAS PASSED!!! Only with explicit user permission may modifications with functional changes (or those that cannot pass FEV for other reasons) be accepted. In such cases, isolate the specific change that cannot be FEVed by breaking the change into its simplest incremental parts and isolating only one specific increment that is not FEVed succesfully. This specific delta must be listed in the tracking artifact.

Feedback from the FEV tool is limited. You may get more information by providing a configuration file (based on the default) that maps internal signals.

Throughout the conversion process, keep the refactored code reasonably aligned with the original. Maintain similar comments and structure. In the end, we want code that most accurately reflects the original, with the main difference being the use of TL-Verilog.

Unless you are failing to make forward progress and need user intervention, KEEP GOING! Your mission is not accomplished until the conversion is complete.

SandPiper warnings indicate real issues and should be addressed immediately.

Incremental Conversion Tasks

Code conversion can be achieve through these conversion tasks, which may involve one or more refactoring steps, each FEVed. Detailed descriptions of each task are provided for reference in `conversion_tasks.md`. Task names are kept consistent here and in `conversion_tasks.md` to assist with RAG retrieval. For example, information about the "Preparation" step, can be found in `conversion_tasks.md` under the heading `## Task: Preparation`.

- Preparation: Define the code that will be converted and identify issues and assumptions. (No FEV for this task.)
- Reset and Clock: Ensure proper clock and reset signals (if needed).
- TLV File Format: Format the file as a TL-Verilog file with module contents in an `SV_plus` region.
- Signal Naming: Update the Verilog signals to conform to TL-Verilog naming convensions.
- Signals to Pipesignals: Convert from using Verilog signals to using TL-Verilog pipesignals (boolean and bit-vector signals only).
- Non-vector Signals: Non-vector signal types are awkward in TL-Verilog; convert these to pipesignals.
- If/Else and Case to Ternary: `if`/`else`/`case` expressions are discouraged in TL-Verilog and are converted to ternary expressions.
- Migrate from `\SV_plus` to `\TLV`: Migrate Verilog-style expressions in `\SV_plus` region(s) to `\TLV`-style expressions.
- Consolidate the SV-TLV Interface: Isolate the transition from Verilog to (timing-abstract) TL-Verilog and back.
